# Crude Oil Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict crude oil prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to forecast future prices.

## Objectives
- Data Collection: Gather historical crude oil price data from reliable sources.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and prepare the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that could impact crude oil prices.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Model Training: Train the selected models on historical data.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Prediction:Use trained models to forecast future crude oil prices.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection:
   - Utilize APIs or datasets (e.g., Quandl, EIA) to fetch historical crude oil prices.
   - Handle missing data and outliers appropriately.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling null values.
   - Normalize or scale the data as needed.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create time-based features (e.g., moving averages, lagged values).
   - Include external factors (e.g., geopolitical events, economic indicators) that influence crude oil prices.

4. Model Selection:
   - Experiment with various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
   - Consider ensemble methods for improved accuracy.

5. Model Training:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the models using historical data.

6. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Compare different models to determine the most accurate one.

7. Prediction:
   - Use the best-performing model to forecast crude oil prices for future periods.
   - Visualize predictions and provide insights into price trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models), matplotlib, seaborn
- Data Sources: Quandl API, EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) datasets
